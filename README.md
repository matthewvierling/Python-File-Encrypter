# Python-File-Encrypter 

NOTE: this is for python 3

This is a file encryption script that will encrypt any type of file. 

at the moment the only known issue is when you try to encrypt larger files (over 5Mb) a memeory error is thrown.
-I am working on that at the moment.

This is not entended to be used to store secure information unless you trust the code. I am not familiar with encryption and security and I don't know how secure this actually is. This is just something I put together for fun because I am intrigued by cryptography and security.

I will try to keep updating this as I continue me education in computer science and learn more about encryption and security.
